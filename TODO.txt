Hey team. Here are the different parts we need to handle for the project

1: environment set up 
    -use virtualenv?
    -get a requirements file
    -.sh scripts to load everything
    -need to figure out pytorch vs tf, pickle, numpy, logger, 
    
2: data download/processing/cleaning
    - write .sh script to download yelp photo data using wget?
    - reduce entire JSON data to just photos and yelp ratings
    - write a loader class, needs to follow data_loader API for pytorch
    - train/val/test set

3: model building, classifier
    - start with this
    - use GoogleNet/ResNet pretrained layers for speed/accuracy
    - do architecture surgery on last few layers for yelp review
    - begin classifying, tune hyperparameters

4: model building, GAN
    - honestly not sure what this entails
    - but y'all do and I will soon!

5: testing / analysis
    - how well can we predict yelp scores with thorough hyperparameter tuning?
    - what do fail cases look like? 
    - GAN stuff idk
